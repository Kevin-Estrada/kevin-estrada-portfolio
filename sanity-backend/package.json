Over the course of the time, I have been learning some CSS tatics as well as HTML, to the point where I decided to utilize SASS to help ease some of the repetition in the css code. In addition, to help with the design template, I decided to use Bootstrap 5 to help build certain components that are more fluid in design. Below you can find a list of the things that I plan to use in this project",
